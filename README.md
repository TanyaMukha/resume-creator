# Resume Creator

## 🌟 Project Overview
This project started as a demonstration of my frontend development skills but evolved into something more experimental and AI-enhanced. While the UI design and PDF template were generated using AI, all functional implementation and logic were developed by me.

## 🚧 Current State
The project is currently in active development and continues to evolve. It serves as a showcase of my development process and learning journey rather than a final product.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Tauri Framework
- Database: SQLite
- PDF Resume Generation
- Auto Database Creation on Project Launch
- AI-Assisted UI Design

## ⚠️ Technical Notes
The project is not currently set up for local deployment due to:
- Significant changes in SQLite database schema
- Outdated database creation scripts
- Need for data structure updates

## 🔄 Development Plans
The project is actively being improved with several planned enhancements:
- Database structure updates
- Code optimization
- Additional features
- Documentation updates

## 🎯 Project Purpose
While this project may not fully demonstrate my technical capabilities, it showcases:
- Ability to integrate AI-generated solutions
- Experience with modern frameworks (Tauri)
- Database management skills (SQLite)
- Continuous learning and improvement approach
